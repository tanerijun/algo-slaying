## About

This repository contains my solutions to DSA problems from Leetcode, HackerRank, etc.

I sometimes also write my thinking process for the solutions on
[my blog](https://vitaneri.com/tags/leetcode/).

## Running leetcode-solution-with-testcase

The TypeScript solutions in `leetcode-solution-with-testcase` are intended to be run using Deno.

So, the first step is to
[install Deno](https://deno.land) if you haven't have it installed.

If you are using VSCode, you should also install the
[Deno extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
for better experiences.

To run the test, simply run `deno run <path_to_file>` in your terminal

## Other folders

Solutions in the other folders can be executed normally.

For JS/TS, use: node, deno, bun, tsc, tsm, tsx, etc.
For Go, use: go
