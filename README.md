## TS-LeetCode

This repository contains my solution to various LeetCode's problem in TypeScript.

I sometimes also write my thinking process for the solutions on [my blog](https://vitaneri.com/tags/leetcode/).

## Running Locally

This repository is intended to be run using Deno. So, the first step is to [install Deno](https://deno.land) if you haven't have it installed.

If you are using VSCode, you should also install the [Deno extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) for better experiences.

To run the test, simply type this command in your terminal:

```
deno test folder_name/test.ts
deno test 1.TwoSum/test.ts
deno test 2.AddTwoNumbers/test.ts
```
