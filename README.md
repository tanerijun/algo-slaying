## LeetCode

This repository contains my solution to various LeetCode problems.

I sometimes also write my thinking process for the solutions on
[my blog](https://vitaneri.com/tags/leetcode/).

## Running Locally

The TypeScript solutions are intended to be run using Deno. So, the first step is to
[install Deno](https://deno.land) if you haven't have it installed.

If you are using VSCode, you should also install the
[Deno extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
for better experiences.

To run the test, simply run `deno test` in your terminal. For example:

```
deno test folder_name/test.ts
deno test 1.TwoSum/test.ts
deno test 2.AddTwoNumbers/test.ts
```
