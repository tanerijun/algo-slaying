# Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MedianFinder()
# obj.addNum(num)
# param_2 = obj.findMedian()

# Follow up:
#
# 1. If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
# We can maintain an integer array of length 100 to store the count of each number along with a total count. Then, we can iterate over the array to find the middle value to get our median.
# Time and space complexity would be O(100) = O(1).
#
# 2. If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
# In this case, we need an integer array of length 100 and a hashmap for these numbers that are not in [0,100].
